I got bored coding in monospace so built Cursive Coder to write code in flowing cursive script with extensive color and theme control.

üé® Just released: 33 Cursive Terminal Themes with Interactive Selector

Built a complete cursive terminal theme system with Victor Mono italic font. Features both CLI and web-based theme selectors.

**Quick Install:**
```
git clone github.com/midnightnow/Cursive-Terminal
cd Cursive-Terminal/scripts
./install-all-themes.sh
./theme-selector.sh
```

**What's included:**
‚Ä¢ 33 hand-crafted themes across 5 categories
‚Ä¢ Interactive CLI selector with live preview
‚Ä¢ Web-based visual theme picker
‚Ä¢ One-command installation
‚Ä¢ Saves theme preference to shell profile

**Theme Categories:**
- Dark (9): Including pirate-scroll üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è and vampires-letter üßõ
- Light Manuscript (6): Ancient papyrus, calligraphy styles
- Colorful (6): Rainbow prism, neon cyberpunk, cotton candy
- Business (6): Office memo, blueprint tech, legal document  
- WCAG-AA (6): High contrast, accessibility focused

**Cool features:**
- Press 'r' for random theme discovery
- Direct theme access: just type theme name
- Search by name or description
- Categories right in main menu (no sub-menus!)
- Preview mode to try before applying

**Color Demo:**
Run `./colored_text_demo.sh` to see:
- Rainbow text effects
- Syntax highlighting
- Git status colors
- 256-color gradients
- True color support
- ASCII art in cursive

The selector shows live previews with code samples. Each theme completely transforms your terminal - from vampire's blood-red on black velvet to pirate's weathered parchment with gold accents.

Works with bash/zsh on macOS/Linux. Best with Victor Mono or any italic-supporting font.

**Example themes:**
- `vampires-letter`: Dark velvet with blood-red cursor
- `pirate-scroll`: Weather-beaten parchment, treasure-gold
- `rainbow-prism`: Dark background, vibrant rainbow syntax
- `ancient-papyrus`: Aged manuscript feel
- `neon-cyberpunk`: Matrix-style green on black

Transform every command into calligraphy. Because life's too short for boring monospace!
